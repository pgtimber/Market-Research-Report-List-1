<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Al-Ni Catalyst Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Activated</li><li>Non-Activated</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Al-Ni catalyst market can be divided into two main types: activated and non-activated. Activated Al-Ni catalysts are those that have been treated or modified to increase their catalytic activity, typically through techniques such as doping or coating. On the other hand, non-activated Al-Ni catalysts are in their original state without any additional treatments or modifications. Both types of catalysts have their own applications and advantages, with activated catalysts being more efficient and non-activated catalysts being simpler and more cost-effective.</p></p>
