<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Active Toughening Agent for Epoxy Resin Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Rubber Toughening Agent</li><li>Thermoplastic Resin Toughening Agent</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Active toughening agents for epoxy resin are used to enhance the mechanical properties of epoxy resin such as impact resistance and toughness. There are two main types of active toughening agents: rubber toughening agents and thermoplastic resin toughening agents. Rubber toughening agents disperse rubber particles throughout the epoxy resin, increasing toughness and flexibility. Thermoplastic resin toughening agents, on the other hand, use thermoplastic particles to improve the impact resistance and strength of epoxy resin. Both types of toughening agents play a crucial role in improving the performance of epoxy resin in various applications.</p></p>
