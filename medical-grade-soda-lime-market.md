<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Medical Grade Soda Lime Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>White to Violet</li><li>Pink to White</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Medical Grade Soda Lime comes in two types: White to Violet and Pink to White. White to Violet soda lime turns from white to violet as it absorbs carbon dioxide during anesthesia. This color change helps medical professionals monitor the level of CO2 in a patient's breath. Pink to White soda lime starts pink and turns white when it is exhausted and can no longer absorb CO2 effectively. Both types play a crucial role in ensuring the safety and success of anesthesia procedures in medical settings.</p></p>
