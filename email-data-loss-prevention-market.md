<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Email Data Loss Prevention Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Ruled-based DLP</li><li>Machine Learning DLP</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Email Data Loss Prevention (DLP) is a market that offers solutions to prevent unintentional or unauthorized transmission of sensitive information via email. Ruled-based DLP uses predefined policies to identify and control data leakage, allowing organizations to set rules on what can or cannot be sent. Machine Learning DLP, on the other hand, utilizes AI algorithms to analyze patterns and behavior, learning from previous incidents to proactively identify and prevent data breaches. Both types aim to safeguard sensitive data, but ruled-based DLP relies on predefined rules while machine learning DLP adapts based on learned patterns.</p></p>
