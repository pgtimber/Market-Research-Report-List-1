<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Sealed Maintenance Free (SMF) Batteries Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Absorbed Glass Mat Battery</li><li>Gel Battery</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Sealed Maintenance Free (SMF) Batteries are divided into two main types - Absorbed Glass Mat (AGM) Battery and Gel Battery. AGM batteries use a fiberglass mat to absorb the electrolyte, allowing for better vibration resistance and deep cycling capabilities. Gel batteries, on the other hand, use a gel-like electrolyte to prevent leaks and offer superior performance in extreme temperatures. Both types are ideal for applications where maintenance-free operation and reliability are key factors.</p></p>
