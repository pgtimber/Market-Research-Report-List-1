<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Rotary Coded Switches Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>SMT Type</li><li>Through Hole Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Rotary Coded Switches are available in two main market types: SMT Type and Through Hole Type. SMT Type switches are surface-mount devices designed to be soldered directly onto the surface of a printed circuit board, enabling faster and more automated assembly processes. Through Hole Type switches, on the other hand, have leads that are inserted through holes in the circuit board and soldered on the other side, providing a more secure connection but requiring more labor-intensive assembly. Both types offer different advantages depending on the specific application requirements.</p></p>
