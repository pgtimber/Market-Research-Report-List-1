<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Liquid Nitrogen Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Cryogenic Distillation</li><li>Pressure Swing Adsorption</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Liquid nitrogen is typically produced using two main processes: cryogenic distillation and pressure swing adsorption. Cryogenic distillation involves separating air into its components using low temperatures, with liquid nitrogen being one of the byproducts. On the other hand, pressure swing adsorption works by adsorbing gases onto a solid material at high pressure and then releasing them at lower pressure to separate nitrogen from other gases. Both processes are commonly used in the market to produce high-quality liquid nitrogen for various industrial applications.</p></p>
