<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Flame Retardant Polyamide Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Halogen Type</li><li>Halogen Free Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Flame retardant polyamide is classified into two main types: Halogen Type and Halogen Free Type. Halogen Type flame retardants contain halogenated compounds like bromine or chlorine which release fumes when burned, effectively suppressing the fire. However, these compounds are toxic and harmful to the environment. On the other hand, Halogen Free Type flame retardants use non-halogenated chemicals like phosphorus or nitrogen to achieve flame resistance without releasing harmful fumes. This type is considered more environmentally friendly and safer for human health.</p></p>
