<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Pedicle Screw Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Polyaxial</li><li>Monoaxial</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Pedicle screw market types refer to different designs of screws used in spinal surgery. Polyaxial screws have a ball-and-socket joint, allowing for multi-axial motion to accommodate various anatomical angles. This provides greater flexibility and ease of insertion. Monoaxial screws, on the other hand, have a fixed angle for insertion, providing stability but less flexibility in adjusting to individual patient anatomy. Surgeons may choose between these market types based on the specific needs of the patient and the complexity of the surgical procedure.</p></p>
