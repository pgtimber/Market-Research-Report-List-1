<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Solder Ball Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Lead Solder Ball</li><li>Lead Free Solder Ball</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Solder balls are tiny spheres used in electronic packaging for connecting components to circuit boards. Lead solder balls contain lead, which is now being phased out due to environmental concerns. Lead-free solder balls use alternative materials like tin, copper, and silver. The market for lead solder balls is decreasing as regulations against lead use become more stringent, while the demand for lead-free solder balls is increasing. Both types serve the same purpose of providing reliable connections in electronic devices.</p></p>
